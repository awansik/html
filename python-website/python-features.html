            <h6>As we have seen in earlier lessons, Python is very easy to code. Compared to other popular 
                languages like Java and C++, it is easier to code in Python.<br/>
                Anyone can learn python syntax in just a few hours. Though sure, mastering Python requires 
                learning about all its advanced concepts and packages and modules.<br/>
                That takes time. Thus, it is programmer-friendly. Being a high-level language, Python code 
                is quite like English. Looking at it, you can tell what the code<br/> 
                is supposed to do. Also, since it is dynamically-typed, it mandates indentation. 
                This aids readability.</h6>

        <span style="color:rgb(90, 88, 88)"><h3>Expressive</h3></span>
        <span style="color:rgb(90, 88, 88)">
            <h6>First, let’s learn about expressiveness. Suppose we have two languages A and B, and all
                    programs that can be made in A can be made in B using local transformations.<br/>
                    However, there are some programs that can be made in B, but not in A, using local transformations. 
                    Then, B is said to be more expressive than A. Python provides us<br/>
                    with a myriad of constructs that help us focus on the solution rather than on the syntax. 
                    This is one of the outstanding python features that tells you why you should learn Python.</h6>

        <span style="color:rgb(90, 88, 88)"><h3>Free and Open-Source</h3></span>
        <span style="color:rgb(90, 88, 88)">
            <h6>Firstly, Python is freely available. You can download it from the following link
                    https://www.python.org/downloads/<br/>
                    For insight on how to download and install Python, refer to our tutorial on Python Installation.
                    Secondly, it is open-source. This means that its source code is available<br/> 
                    to the public. You can download it, change it, use it, and distribute it. This is called 
                    FLOSS(Free/Libre and Open Source Software). As the Python community,<br/> 
                    we’re all headed toward one goal- an ever-bettering Python.</h6>
