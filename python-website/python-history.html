                <h6>Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 
                by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)<br/>
                in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable 
                of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
                Van Rossum<br/> 
                remains Python's principal author. Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had
                many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support<br/> 
                for Unicode. With this release, the development process became more transparent and 
                community-backed.
                Python 3.0 (initially called Python 3000 or py3k) was released on<br/>
                3 December 2008 after a long testing period. It is a major revision of the language that 
                is not completely backward-compatible with previous versions. However, many of its<br/>
                major features have been backported to the Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series, and releases 
                of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2<br/> 
                code to Python 3. Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015, then postponed to 2020
                out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be<br/> 
                forward-ported to Python 3. In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to Go 
                transcompiler to improve performance under concurrent workloads.</h6>
